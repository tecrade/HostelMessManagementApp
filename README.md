# 🍽️ Hostel Mess Management App

A modern, cloud-based **Hostel Mess Management System** built with **React, Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Firestore**. The application enables hostel administrators to manage daily meal attendance, special food items, and monthly billing while allowing students to securely view their own mess records without editing privileges.

Designed as a **multi-tenant SaaS application**, each hostel or mess operates independently using a unique **Mess Code**, allowing unlimited hostel administrations to use the same platform.

## 🍛 Meal Management

Supports recording attendance for:

- ✅ Breakfast
- ✅ Lunch
- ✅ Dinner

Each meal is individually tracked.

Example:

| Date | Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 10 Jul | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## 🍗 Special Items

Instead of manually entering prices every day, administrators maintain a reusable menu of special food items.

Example

| Item | Price |
|------|--------|
| Fish Curry | ₹80 |
| Chicken Fry | ₹120 |
| Egg Roast | ₹20 |
| Beef Curry | ₹100 |

While updating attendance, admins simply select the special item from a dropdown.

The application automatically calculates the total.

---

## 💰 Billing System

Monthly bill is calculated automatically.

Daily Total

```
Breakfast Price
+ Lunch Price
+ Dinner Price
+ Selected Special Items
```

Monthly Total

```
Sum of all Daily Totals
```

Administrators can change meal prices anytime from the Settings page.

---

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

Every hostel has its own isolated workspace.

```
Admin A
│
├── Members
├── Attendance
├── Specials
└── Settings

Admin B
│
├── Members
├── Attendance
├── Specials
└── Settings
```

Students access their hostel by entering a unique **Mess Code**.

Example

```
NSSCE-A
HOSTEL01
BOYS-HOSTEL
```

The same application supports unlimited hostels.
